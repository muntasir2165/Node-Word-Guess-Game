# Node-Word-Guess-Game

A Node.js Command Line Word Guess Game

## Project Motivation

This app was developed as part of the second Node.js homework assignment at the University of Toronto Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. This project is essentially an interactive command line word guess game where the user has to guess the letters of a word/phrase. The app has been configured to prompt the user for the number of words they want to guess in a game and subsequently, the random word letter guesses.

## Getting Started

1) Either download the zipped project from GitHub or clone the repo into your local machine.
2) Cd into the directory Node-Word-Guess-Game
3) Run: npm install
4) Run: node index.js x
	where x is a placeholder for the number of words you want to guess in a game. If no number/invalid value is passed, the default value of 3 is used.
5) Follow the instructions and try to guess the letters of the word/phrase
